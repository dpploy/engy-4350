    "### <span style=\"color:blue\"> Consider a **fission-electric cell**, constructed with a thin layer of $^{235}$U, pure metal (mass density 19.1 g/cm$^3$), as shown in the diagram below. The cell is inserted in a nuclear reactor with a constant thermal neutron flux where: $\\varphi = 10^{14}\\,\\frac{\\text{neutrons}}{\\text{cm}^2\\,\\text{s}}$. The area of the $^{235}$U layer facing the inside of the cell is constant, that is to say, only the thickness of the layer changes during irradiation. An electric current runs on the external circuit and it will be too small to measure after enough time has elapsed.\n",
